AssTracker
========

AssTracker is a clone of http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/ except it's
open-source, more configurable, and doesn't require a managed runtime that 
takes up 25 MB of memory.

It is an OS X Status Bar Applet that displays how long you've been 
using your computer and plays a sound to remind you when you've been using 
it for too long without a break.

The time that you consider to be a break and how long between reminders is
configurable by using the Preferences window accessible from the Status Item
once you run the program.
